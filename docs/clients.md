*Read this in other languages: [English](clients.md), [简体中文](clients-zh.md).*

*To connect using IPsec/XAuth mode, see: [Configure IPsec/XAuth VPN Clients](clients-xauth.md)*

After <a href="https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn" target="_blank">setting up your own VPN server</a>, follow these steps to configure your devices. IPsec/L2TP is natively supported by Android, iOS, OS X, and Windows. There is no additional software to install. Setup should only take a few minutes. In case you are unable to connect, first check to make sure the VPN credentials were entered correctly.
